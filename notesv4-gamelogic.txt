basic objectives, same every level used multiple times:

upload command: Takes 1 file, acts like cp. Used for specific file objective
access directory: ticks when you access a specfic directory (path included so you cant just mkdir > cd into the name of it)
file not exist/delete file: ticks when file doesnt exist (player deleted it)
login as someone: access user/elevate permissions
kill/stop: stop a process 

Summary Table: Basic Objective Library
Data Theft	Target file exists in /home/player/	"Steal the bank_details.csv file."
Access Directory Directory in file system, access it. 
Sabotage	File path root/sys/boot.conf == null	"Delete the system boot config."
Infiltration	Current User == admin	"Escalate privileges to root."
Proccess kill	Process sys_monitor is not running	"Kill the monitoring service."

some levels will need custom built objective logic, for instance, abstract 1 off concepts like create 10 copies of a specific file. 


Level phases determine dialogue. For instance, phase 1 of level 1 will have 3 objectives like (access dir Z, copy file You to location, upload file X) phase 1 will also have dialogue at the beginning. 

Level data object needs to include these, and engine needs to know how to interperet it. 

simple:
Required commands: Just text data that needs to be parsed and displayed
file system: an object, already defined just plug it in (I think its this simple but idk)
Information: Repeat most recent dialogue

medium difficult to implement:
dialogue in general: not completly sure how to implement this. has function that displays the dialogue so shouldnt be hard, the function just takes strings seperated by commas for line seperation

hard to implement: 
Objectives, needs to range from repeatable ones like upload file or access directory to more custom stuff like create 10 copies of a specific file.
