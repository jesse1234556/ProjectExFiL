Project ExFilNotes Mission 2 ideas

Phase 1 TBD


Phase 2: Hiding your tracks

This server is special, I still need to make use of it.
So heres what we are going to do, try to keep up;
Your tracks are currently inside of Command_Logs.json 
But they are also in another file called Logs.json
I need to keep that Logs.json file but I need it disrupted.
Delete the Command_logs so they cant directly see your actions, 
Logs.json is alright to keep since its rarely checked and has too much data to parse. 
but just to be sure we are going to be doing some obsfucation. 
Install my package 'RandomLogs' are then run the RandLogs command to create a bunch of fake logs,
rename the original Logs.json to be "Logs85.json" so I know where it is.
