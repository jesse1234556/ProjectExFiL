Project ExFilNotes Mission 2 ideas

Phase 1 TBD


Phase 2: Hiding your tracks

This server is special, I still need to make use of it.
Your tracks are currently inside of Logs.json 
I need to keep that Logs.json file but I need it disrupted.
Delete the logs so they cant directly see your actions, 
but just to be sure we are going to be doing some obsfucation. 
Install my package 'RandomLogs' are then run the RandLogs command to create a bunch of fake logs, 
rename the original Logs.json to be "Logs.json" so I know where it is. 


Mission 3 ideas

Touch command too many times sets off the intrusion detection system (hackerman wants this to happen, to disrupt or something)


Split into 3rds?
Ideas for mission play sidebar

Mission objectives
Needed commands (with clickable pop up manual?)
Help button (hacker gives you next steps?)
