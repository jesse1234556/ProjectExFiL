Working on objectives:
Give files ID's to prevent touch creating files with same name of course; 

ID system: 
Files will start with f, follwed by the ID in the phase its from, usually order in the objectives. And the phase its on.
Directories are the same but with d instead of f

For instance, a file for a mission thats in the first phase of the in the first objective list would be "f11"
(f and d always lowercase in ID's)

Testing first objective: 
(upload the 'shadow' file. )


mission objectives are split into codes:
1 = upload file. Objective tracker gets updated when upload command is ran. 
2 = access directory. Object tracker checks if cwd is on the ID of the dir you want.
3 = file deleted. Objective tracker checks if file exists after every command. 
4 = read file. Use 'cat'

missiondata object needs to be created.

Needs to include. each phases dialogue and mission objectives. As well as fs object included with metadata; username, hostname, home.
the mission objectives could just be whatever of the 5(start with just the first 3 which are access dir, delete file and upload file.) your trying to do and then the ID of the fs object you want. 
The id inside of objectives is slightly different, 'X.Y.ID' X is the phase its for, 
So if you want them to upload something in phase 1, if its the first one in phase 1, you do '1.1.f11' 1 to notate upload. 
Also need the text/title for the objective to display.
